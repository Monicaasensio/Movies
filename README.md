# Movie-List
GI Week 14

My movie application functions in the terminal. Once the movie function is called back with a movie title, it will find the movie ID and use that to find the results of similar movies using the api specified url and my similarMovie function.

After several attempts, I was unable to connect my html with my back end but it is fully functioning in the console.
